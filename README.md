## Verlet Integrator: A quick summary

 - Verlet Integration is a numerical method used to integrate Newton’s equations of motion. It is frequently used to calculate trajectories of particles in molecular dynamics simulations and computer graphics. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration)

 - The Verlet integrator provides good numerical stability, as well as other properties that are important in physical systems such as time reversibility and preservation of the symplectic form on phase space, at no significant additional computational cost over the simple Euler method. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration)

## Content

In this integrator you have two main functions:

	1) You can test the integrator, in which case the first and last 20 frames will be displayed on the screen after the input of the initial data.

	2) You can use the integrator, in which case you can see the final numeric data or a graphic representation of the data inputted before. 

		The graphic representation can be paused, showing on the screen the data of the moment
		The numeric data of the integrator can be compared to the numeric data from Newton's Laws.

## Disclosure

This is an integrator made by second year students of the Videogame Design and Development degree taught at CITM.

The integrator has been made using C++, using SDL and pugi libraries.
